1)Data science has evolved from its roots in statistics and computer science to a dynamic field encompassing big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>2)Early data processing has been replaced by modern techniques involving AI, LLMs, cloud computing, and automated processes, driven by the exponential growth of data and the need for faster, more sophisticated insights.</p>
<p>3)This evolution has led to a demand for professionals with broader skill sets that include programming languages like Python, while simultaneously making some data science tasks more accessible through no-code platforms.</p>
